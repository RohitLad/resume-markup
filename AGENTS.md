### Service Layer
The application uses a service layer pattern. Key services:
- `SubscriptionService` - Subscription lifecycle management
- `OrderService` - Order processing
- `CheckoutService` - Checkout flow logic
- `PlanService` - Plan management
- `DiscountService` - Discount application
- `InvoiceService` - Invoice generation

### Payment Provider Architecture
Payment providers are abstracted via contracts in `app/Services/PaymentProviders/`:
- Each provider implements common interfaces
- Supports Stripe, Paddle, Lemon Squeezy, and Offline payments
- Provider-specific data stored in `*PaymentProviderData` models
- Webhooks handle provider callbacks

### Event-Driven Architecture
The application uses Laravel events for domain actions:
- **Order Events**: Order created, completed, failed
- **Subscription Events**: Created, updated, cancelled, renewed, trial started/ended
- **User Events**: Registered, verified, etc.
- Listeners handle side effects (emails, notifications, metrics)

## Coding Standards

### Primary Guidelines
When working on this Laravel/PHP project, **always** follow the coding guidelines at @ai/laravel-php-ai-guidelines.md. Key principles:
- Follow Laravel conventions first
- Use PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-12 standards
- Use typed properties over docblocks
- Prefer early returns (happy path last)
- Use camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes
- Use kebab-case for routes, snake_case for config keys
- Avoid else statements when possible
- Use constructor property promotion
- String interpolation over concatenation
- Always use curly braces for control structures

### SaaSykit-Specific Conventions
- Services should be stateless and injected via dependency injection
- Use DTOs for complex data structures passed between layers
- Event/Listener pattern for side effects
- Filament for admin UI (avoid custom controllers when possible)
- Livewire for interactive frontend components
- Payment provider logic should be isolated in provider-specific classes
- All monetary amounts use the `Money` package
- Translations via `__()` function
- Use Spatie Permissions for authorization
- Queue long-running tasks (emails, webhooks, metrics)

### Database Conventions
- Use migrations for all schema changes
- Foreign keys with cascade/set null as appropriate
- Use proper indexes for performance
- Version history via `mpociot/versionable` where needed

### Testing Guidelines
- Feature tests for critical flows (subscription, checkout, payment)
- Unit tests for services with complex logic
- Use factories for test data
- Mock external services (payment providers, email)
- Run tests before committing: `vendor/bin/phpunit`

## Environment Setup

### First-Time Setup
```bash
composer install
npm install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
npm run dev
```

### Development Tools
- **Horizon Dashboard**: `/horizon` (queue monitoring)
- **Telescope Dashboard**: `/telescope` (debugging, dev only)
- **Admin Panel**: `/admin`
- **User Dashboard**: `/dashboard`
